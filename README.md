## Major Topics
The repository is organized by the major topics of the course as follows:
- **Introduction to Java**
    - Basic syntax and program structure.
- **Using Classes and Objects**
    - Examples of class definitions, object instantiation, and basic methods.
- **Flow Control**
    - Code examples demonstrating `if`, `else`, loops (`for`, `while`), and decision-making structures.
- **Writing Classes**
    - In-depth examples on constructing classes with methods, attributes, and constructors.
- **Arrays**
    - Single and multidimensional array usage and operations.
- **Searching and Sorting**
    - Implementations of common searching and sorting algorithms using arrays.
- **Multidimensional Arrays**
    - Advanced examples using two-dimensional arrays.
- **Exceptions and I/O Operations**
    - Handling Java input/output operations along with exception handling practices.
- **Inheritance**
    - Demonstrations of inheritance and polymorphism in Java.
- **Recursion**
    - Recursive programming examples, including simple and complex use cases.
- **Merge Sort**
    - Detailed implementation of the merge sort algorithm.
- **Linked Lists, Queues, and Stacks**
    - Implementations of these data structures using Java.
- **Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees**
    - Code for creating and managing binary trees and binary search trees.
